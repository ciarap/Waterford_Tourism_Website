      <h2> Traditional Pubs </h2>
      <p>
        If you just want to relax and enjoy the atmosphere in a pub with character, there are a number of excellent pubs scattered around the City which you should check out.<br> Ideally located beside Reginald's Tower is The Reg, which offers entertainment 7 nights a week. <br> Another option is Downes on Thomas Street, which was established in 1759 and is still in the same eccentric family for six generations. It is also one of the few remaining houses to bottle its own whiskey.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
       Located down the narrow streets of Waterford City's historic quarter, The Munster Bar was established as a public house in 1822 and has been in the hands of the Fitzgerald family since 1952. The interior has beautiful oak panelled walls and elegant fireplaces. <br>Other traditional pubs also well worth a visit include Geoffs Bar, The Gingerman, Katty Barrys, Jordans and the Three Shippes which are in the City Centre and within easy walking distance of each other.
